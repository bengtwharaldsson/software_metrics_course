I'm using the newly released Fedora 42, which ships GCC 15 already, and encountered build errors. The errors are caused by GCC 15 requiring `stdint.h` to be explicitly imported ([link](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-15/porting_to.html#header-dep-changes)):
```
In particular, the following headers are used less widely within libstdc++ and may need to be included explicitly when compiling with GCC 15:
    <stdint.h> (for int8_t, int32_t etc.) and <cstdint> (for std::int8_t, std::int32_t etc.)
    <ostream> (for std::endl, std::flush etc.)
```

This PR adds the required imports.

<details>
  <summary>Build errors</summary>

This issue mentions incorrect parsing of the mandatory conf files. if there are files with similar names all would be parsed. this is a fix for it. Details
An example of erroneous parsing:
VSOMEIP_MANDATORY_CONFIGURATION_FILES=service.json,common.json then only service.json and common.json should be read and parsed. Currently if there are the following files in the configuration folder: main_service.json
other_service.json
service.json
All are parsed. Changing the comparison method for incoming config files fixes it.

844,Fix incorrect microsecond extraction in logging timestamps,closed,2025-02-06T10:02:13Z,2025-04-08T10:46:14Z,2025-04-08T10:46:14Z,2025-04-08T10:46:13Z,yaqian256,83148975,1df6987710999c41e37499af09f31c08a1eb5982,,,,,,,"This PR fixes an issue in the logging module where the microsecond part of the timestamp was calculated incorrectly. Previously, the code used:

```cpp
auto its_ms = (when_.time_since_epoch().count() / 100) % 1000000;
```
However, this approach incorrectly scaled the raw duration count. The correct division factor should have been `1000` (not `100`), or better yet, the calculation can be performed in a type-safe manner using `std::chrono::duration_cast`.

The updated code now correctly extracts the microsecond portion by converting the duration to microseconds.

You can see the difference of the two approaches [here!](https://tio.run/##pVTbattAEH33VwwpBRkaO31VbEMvr2mhpG8Fsd4dW4v3IvYSNZR8uzsraSWZJJDSfRBiNefMmTPH5k1zfeT8fH4nDVdRIGx47ayxu8V0I60PDpme33EfhDRht1jQEzSTpljCnwXQYTFYMLaFLVBRWfaEZekffUBdcWX5qSypoFjeTgDH2orbSGTbBF4FqbHy1A8rbCyvi@Wq@5xAHWq9hut/Ohn1XQn41DTOMl6XcMdMZAqYk6HWGCQHbs0DOi@tWWXIfS093dPgzPuo0UOoWaAHAiFO4NBbFQNBgAo/3tyAYcZ6JCrhR5av8kGSaUfYP3Y1rY0kpW83I@tdIEu05C6TfMgkVGYgsFPi0VZEFbuG6YCSWgbfMTlmjria7LVKVNqTt8Vk9DoBl/A@48nY/3P2G7YzZ3/6pFFEx5IxFWc@wMG6V/2Vg3IaWGs0AgWwgQz2yFn0CDKkMvzdKMnpne1t7J2LhiafzWuw7ee9iOCFmM3Fp7nZu@LlBI4RvPAsxyqGZhBDcYgqy@m7JJ2bDVz9YO18y8XljyLr6wCp0bKEq4SblpZIfpmr2xe472YjQDGPeaYZUvBmjvlCM8fg7Mgxzt8k5UyV8MXqhjnsE93acYs4OCIPUOQ8bge@/OfxXNFnG@oZBdCLiJzCkeg909nu1TjRE6CirLxGeP9M1sQp5OGADsnnvMOJtZ/UYYjOAC3@aXE@/wU ""C++ (gcc) – Try It Online"")

This is a followup on https://github.com/COVESA/vsomeip/pull/559.  The issue is a sporative (through rare) `SIGTERM` on exit from `routingmanagerd`.

The key signature of the crash appears to be:

## General CMakeLists improvements - cmake v2→v3

- Included a `.cmake-format` file, and ran applied it to the main `CMakeList` files in this project.
  - The format file does a poor job on `if` and `foreach` blocks, but I believe overall it does a better job that the default settings.  The main benefit is a consistent format
- Use targets instead of lib/include variables in CMake
- [Conditionally] Linking DLT as a target
- Write `internal.hpp` to build directory instead of source to prevent needless rebuilds
  - The include directives for this file are also updated in the code to use include paths rather than relative paths.
- Remove hard coded `CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE`, this should be injected by the user if so desired
- ""wrap""ing (ld's `--wrap` option) the ""socket"" symbol, see `wrappers.cpp`
- Added install directive to `vsomeip/example/hello_world` and `vsomeip_ctrl`
- Platform conditional socket lib linkage
- hello_world code uses `ENABLE_SIGNALS`, but its setting was missing in CMake
- Improve setup for boost stacktrace, really only helps on Linux and requires the `backtrace.h` file
- Added QNX platform section, though the credential code changes for QNX are not included in this commit.
- Use a CACHE variable for `VSOMEIP_BASE_PATH`.  Upstream defaults this to `/var` for QNX which is a very bad choice.

710,Control SD sync/async behaviour with env var on QNX,closed,2024-05-27T19:48:36Z,2025-01-28T13:38:26Z,2025-01-28T13:38:26Z,,kheaactua,2363406,,,,,,,,"# Target was 3.4.10

## Description

This is a change intended for systems like QNX which do not generally have a service like netlink monitoring the network status that can easily be tied into.  This is not setup to be used/enabled on Linux/Android.

This allows us to launch and use a routing manager with local UDS communication before remote networking is available which simplifies our startup graph and saves time during startup.  This is in contrast to the current version where SD will fail to load if networking is not available at process start - leaving the routing manager in an error state.

I have been using this change for 1-2 years now and it has been very beneficial.  

## Usage

This behaviour can be enabled by exporting the following environment variables:
```sh
# Env var that if exists will cause SD setup to be performed asynchronously and
# wait on network availability.  This wait also impacts the routing_manager to
# also wait until a network interface is available before issuring OFFERs
export VSOMEIP_USE_ASYNCHRONOUS_SD

# Iff SD is running synchronously, the existence of this env var will cause the
# SD setup to still block on network availability. (mostly a testing scenario)
export VSOMEIP_WAIT_FOR_INTERFACE

# The current waiting mechanism is to block until a file (specified by this
# define)
export VSOMEIP_NETWORK_INT_READY_FILE=<file path of file created when network available>
```

This is implemented by modifying the signature of `service_discovery::start()` in order to accept a callback send from `routing_manager_impl`.

## Notes:
- mutexes
  - `sd_impl::endpoint_` is now mutex protected
  - `rm_impl::pending_sd_offers_mutex_` is a recursive mutex, as now it can be called in its own thread and the new thread in SD
- There is no timeout on the `waitfor`.  The original implementation had a configurable timeout, however because timing out left us in an error state anyways, this timeout was removed (raised to `numeric_limits<int>::max()` = ~45 days, give or take.)",,,,async_sd,master,,,True

During `tcp_client_endpoint_impl::restart()` the `queue_` will be drained, messages printed like

```
tce::restart: dropping message: remote:10.6.0.3:30510 (30fd): [0402.0001.018e] size: 23
```

and if `is_sending_` was set nothing will unset. Later in `connect_cbk()`:

```
auto its_entry = get_front();
if (its_entry.first) {
    is_sending_ = true;
    strand_.dispatch(std::bind(&client_endpoint_impl::send_queued,
            this->shared_from_this(), its_entry));
    VSOMEIP_WARNING << __func__ << "": resume sending to: ""
            << get_remote_information();
}
```
there's nothing queued, no reason to call `send_queued`, therefore no callback is going to clear the flag. Flag `is_sending_` remains set ""forever"" and the train logic remains blocked from sending. From a user perspective the client endpoint would receive notifications but never transmit anything again.

# Ensure departure timer does not go negative

There is a calculation 3.1.20 in `implementation/endpoints/include/buffer.hpp` that results in a negative number in case the timer is already expired:
```
void update_departure_time_and_stop_departure() {
    departure_ = departure_timer_->expires_from_now();
```
We need to implement a `floor()` so the departure is either in the future, or zero meaning ready to depart, but never negative. Like:
```
departure_ = departure_timer_->expires_from_now();
if (departure_.count() < 0) {
    departure_ = std::chrono::nanoseconds::zero();
}
```
In case the value goes negative then other calculations fail. That large negative number is kept and used for the next calculated departure time, breaking that one too.",,,,topic/v3.1.20.3-fix-sluggish,maintain/3.1,,,True
